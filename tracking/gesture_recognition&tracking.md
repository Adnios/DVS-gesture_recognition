## Real-Time Hand Tracking and Gesture Recognition System

>2005

- The hand region being tracked is recognized by blob analysis and Kalman filter based approach.
- Extract hand region based on skin color tracking.
- Track and extract the hand from an image sequence.
- Verify the extracted hand region using P2-DHMMs.

## Hand Tracking and Gesture Recognition for Human-Computer Interaction

>2005

1. hand segmentation
    - skin-colour
2. track the position and orientation of the hand
    - pixel-based tracking
3. extract several hand features

# Question

- What's the tracking for? Accuracy or more function?

# Brain Storming

1. hand tracking method:

    - traditional camera, skin color
    - Dynamic Background Suppression
    - YOLO

2. Database
