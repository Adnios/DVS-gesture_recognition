## Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition using Motion Tracking

>2011

- 10 hand signed digits
- skin-subtraction approach
- histogram model
- motion tracking and get the point in histogram

## Real-Time Hand Tracking and Gesture Recognition System

>2005

- The hand region being tracked is recognized by blob analysis and Kalman filter based approach.
- Extract hand region based on skin color tracking.
- Track and extract the hand from an image sequence.
- Verify the extracted hand region using P2-DHMMs.

## Hand Tracking and Gesture Recognition for Human-Computer Interaction

>2005

1. hand segmentation
    - skin-colour
2. track the position and orientation of the hand
    - pixel-based tracking
3. extract several hand features

# Question

- What's the tracking for? Accuracy or more function?
