## A. LeNet-5
LeNet-5[] is a representative convolutional neural network for recogniziong handwritten digits and document recognition. LeNet-5 is a Multilayer Neural Network and it is trained with backpropagation algorithm. This architecture was mainly aimed towards hand-written and machine printed character recognition. 

We trained a CNN on the preprocessed data using the improved LeNet-5.
